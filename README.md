# Portfolio Project in Machine Learning

## Project Description

This project uses data from the [Global Carbon Budget](https://globalcarbonbudget.org/gcb-2024/) dataset to
explore the average global carbon "budget imbalance" over the years 1959-2023. The dataset contains information
from the Global Carbon Project, which is an international research project that aims to help the international
community to build a global and regional carbon budget and to understand the global carbon cycle.

The dataset contains the following columns:

- `Year`
- `fossil emissions excluding carbonation`
- `land-use change emissions`
- `atmospheric growth`
- `ocean sink`
- `land sink`
- `cement carbonation sink`
- `budget imbalance`

## Project Tasks

### Data Exploration and Basic Analysis
1. Load the dataset and explore the columns.
2. Calculate the average global carbon "budget imbalance" over the years 1959-2023.
3. Create a line plot showing the average global carbon "budget imbalance" over the years 1959-2023.
4. Interpret the results and draw conclusions.

### Predictive Modeling: Predicting the "Budget Imbalance"
1. Create a simple linear regression model to predict the "budget imbalance" based on the other columns.
2. Evaluate the model's performance using appropriate metrics.
3. Interpret the results and draw conclusions.

### Predictive Modeling: Predicting the Future "Budget Imbalance"
1. Create a predictive model to forecast the "budget imbalance" for the years 2024-2030.
2. Evaluate the model's performance using appropriate metrics.
3. Interpret the results and draw conclusions.

## Project Goals

To demonstrate the following skills:
- Data exploration and analysis
- Data visualization
- Predictive modeling
- Model evaluation and interpretation
- Communication of results
